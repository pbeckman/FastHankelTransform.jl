In this work we describe a fast algorithm for computing Hankel transforms of
moderate order which combine local and asymptotic expansions with nonuniform
Fast fourier transforms. The resulting algorithm executes in~$\bO (N
\log^2 N)$ time, where~$n$ denotes the number of points in both space and
frequency.  The algorithm can be executed to arbitrary precision, with the
length of the local and asymptotic expansions adjusted accordingly. Several
numerical examples are provided which demonstrate the speed of the algorithm in
multiple regimes, i.e. varying distributions of points and varying orders.
