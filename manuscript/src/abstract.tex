In this work we describe a fast algorithm for computing Hankel transforms of
moderate order which combines local and asymptotic expansions with nonuniform
fast Fourier transforms. The resulting algorithm executes in~$\bO (n \log n)$
time, where~$n$ denotes the number of points in both space and frequency.  The
algorithm can be executed to arbitrary precision $\epsilon$, with the order of
the local and asymptotic expansions adjusted automatically according to
analysis. Several numerical examples are provided which demonstrate the speed of
the algorithm in multiple regimes, i.e. varying distributions of points and
varying orders.
