We describe a fast algorithm for computing discrete Hankel transforms of
moderate orders from $n$ nonuniform points to $m$ nonuniform frequencies in
$\bO\big((m+n)\log\min(n,m)\big)$ operations. Our approach combines local and
asymptotic Bessel function expansions with nonuniform fast Fourier transforms.
The order of each expansion is adjusted automatically according to error
analysis to obtain any desired precision $\epsilon$. Several numerical examples
are provided which demonstrate the speed and accuracy of the algorithm in
multiple regimes and applications.
