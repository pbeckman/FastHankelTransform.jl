In this work we describe a fast algorithm for computing Hankel transforms of
moderate order which combines local and asymptotic expansions with nonuniform
fast Fourier transforms. The resulting algorithm executes in~$\bO (n \log n)$
time, where~$n$ denotes the number of points in both space and frequency.  The
algorithm can be executed to arbitrary precision $\epsilon$, with the order of
the local and asymptotic expansions adjusted automatically according to
analytical considerations. Several numerical examples are provided which
demonstrate the speed of the algorithm in multiple regimes, for example varying
distributions of points and varying orders.
