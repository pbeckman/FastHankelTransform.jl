In this manuscript we've presented a fast algorithm for computing discrete
Hankel transforms in~$\bO(n \log n)$ time, where~$n$ is the number of points in
space and frequency. The algorithm relies on a careful space-frequency analysis
of the Bessel function kernel, judicious use of small-argument series expansions
and large-largement asymptotic expansions, as well as a small number of direct
calculations. The algorithm makes no assumptions on the distribution of points
in space and frequency -- it applies to the fully nonuniform case -- and can be
used for Hankel transforms of higher order with a modest increase in
computational cost. More importantly, the algorithm does not require any
precomputation, in contrast to algorithms based on butterfly factorizations of
the Hankel transform matrix. Significant speedups over the direct calculation
have been demonstrated, as well as asymptotic scaling of the computational
complexity.

Going forward, in order to most efficiently extend the algorithm to arbitrarly
high order Hankel transforms (transforms which appear in various statistical
computations), alternative expansions and asymptotics of~$J_m$ need to be used
and/or derived. This is the focus of ongoing research.

Lastly, the algorithm of this paper is available {\color{red} as a Julia
  package, the source of which can be found at ... }
