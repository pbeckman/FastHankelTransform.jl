In this manuscript we have presented a fast algorithm for computing discrete Hankel
transforms of moderate orders from $n$ nonuniform points to $m$ nonuniform
frequencies in $\bO\big((m+n)\log\min(n,m)\big)$ operations. The algorithm
relies on a careful space-frequency analysis of the Bessel function kernel,
judicious use of small-argument series expansions and large-argument asymptotic
expansions, as well as a small number of direct calculations. The algorithm
makes no assumptions on the distribution of points in space and frequency --- it
applies to the fully nonuniform case --- and can be used for Hankel transforms
of higher order with a modest increase in computational cost. More importantly,
the algorithm does not require any precomputation, in contrast to algorithms
based on butterfly factorizations of the Hankel transform matrix. Significant
speedups over the direct calculation have been demonstrated, as well as
asymptotic scaling of the computational complexity. An implementation of the
algorithm of this paper is available as an open-source Julia package at
\href{https://github.com/pbeckman/FastHankelTransform.jl}{\texttt{github.com/pbeckman/FastHankelTransform.jl}}.

In order to efficiently extend our algorithm to compute arbitrarily high-order
Hankel transforms which are needed for higher-order Fourier-Bessel expansions
and in various high-dimensional statistical
settings~\cite{lord1954a,nolan2013multivariate}, alternative expansions and
asymptotics of~$J_\nu$ need to be used or derived. This is the focus of ongoing
research.
